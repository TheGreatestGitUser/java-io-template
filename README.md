# java-io-template

The point of this repository is to give a fast input/output template for Java. However, it does so using a smaller and simpler method, using StreamTokenizer instead of explicitly defined methods based on reading individual characters from the standard input (like the one here https://github.com/TheGreatestGitUser/long-java-io-template or https://github.com/williamfiset/FastJavaIO).
